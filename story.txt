Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no coin 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on land, I thought I would wander about 
a little and see the distant part of the ocean. It is a way I have of driving off the 
sorrow and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the world; 
whenever it is a cold, gray November in my mind; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
staring before coffin shops, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a firm 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately plunging into the sea, and methodically 
knocking people's heads off—then, I account it high time to get to ship as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the water with me.
I like bananas very much.
